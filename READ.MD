CRIME RECORDS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This is my final project as an intern at Hialb(Hut Innovation lab)
Here I'am using PHP, MYSQL, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, BOOTSTRAP AND HTML to develop this software which basically fucntion
as it's name implies. The system is a two user system consisting of the admin and the police. The admin has full rights 
and the police has limited right.
